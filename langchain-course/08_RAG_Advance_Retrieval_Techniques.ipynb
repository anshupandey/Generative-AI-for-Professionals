This configuration enhances the precision and efficiency of botanical information retrieval and generation, ideal for academic research, educational content, and professional consultation.\n",

        "**Multi-Query Retriever**: This technique allows the system to handle multiple queries simultaneously or queries with multiple components, enhancing the system's ability to retrieve comprehensive information from a large dataset.\n",
        "**Contextual Compression**: Here, relevant information is compressed into context-rich embeddings, preserving essential data while optimizing storage and retrieval processes.\n",
        "**Long-Context Reorder**: This technique reorganizes the retrieved data to maintain coherence and relevance over extended contexts, vital for understanding complex botanical interactions and processes.\n",
        "Weaviate is utilized as the vector database, storing and managing the vector embeddings generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-03 model. These embeddings encode detailed semantic relationships within botanical texts, enabling the system to retrieve highly relevant information rapidly and accurately.\n",

It helps us under-\\nstand why plants are so vitally important to the world. Plants start the majority of\\nfood and energy chains, they provide us with oxygen, food and medicine.\\nPlants can be divided into two groups: plants 1andplants 2. Plants 1contain all pho-\\ntosynthetic organisms which use light, H 2O, and CO 2to make organic compounds\\nand O 2. Plants 1are deﬁned ecologically (based on their role in nature).\\nSome plants 1can be bacteria or even animals! One example of this a green slug,\\nElysia chlorotica (see Fig. 1.1). Green slugs collect chloroplasts from algae and use\\nthem for their entire life as food producers. Therefore, green slugs are both animals\\nand plants 1.\\nPlants 2areall organisms from Vegetabilia kingdom . Normally, plants 2are green\\norganisms with a stem and leaves. We can deﬁne them also as multi-tissued, pri-\\nmarily terrestrial and photosynthetic eukaryotes . This deﬁnition is taxonomical\\n(based on evolution).\\nIt is possible for the organism to be plant 2but not plant 1(see Fig. 1.2). Those who\\nfall into that category, are fully parasitic plants (mycoparasites like Pterospora , root\\nparasites like Hydnora , stem parasites like Cuscuta , and internal parasites like Pi-\\nlostyles) which do not practice photosynthesis but have tissues, terrestrial lifestyle\\nand originated from photosynthetic ancestors.\\n19')"
